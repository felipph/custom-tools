## Custom tools for LLM

This repo aims to build some custom tools fopr LLM applications. For now I'm using for myself with N8N.

The goal is create simple API's to solve simple problems.

 - `GET /convert-url-to-markdown?url={URL_TO_FETCH_CONTENT}` -> Given a url, fetch the html, convert to markdown.

 Looks simple, but I had issues to fetch sites secured by cloudfare. This works, for now... 

### Example
